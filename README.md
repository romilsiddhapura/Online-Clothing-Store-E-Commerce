Online Clothing Retailer
=========

A PHP e-commerce web application.

1. To set this web application, make sure PHP and PHPMyAdmin is installed on your server.
2. Next open PHPMyAdmin, create a database and import the clothing.sql file. This will generate tables in your database on your server.
3. Upload all files on your server except for clothing.sql.
4. The admin user which I have made has an email id admin@gmail.com and the password is admin1234. 
5. Open config.php file and add the details of your PHPMyAdmin's id and password to access the database. Now re-upload this file to the server.
6. Once this is done, go to the url of your website and it should be up and running.

Enjoy!
